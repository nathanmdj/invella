# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Standard Workflow

1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.

## Overview

This is a fully-featured e-invitation RSVP PWA web application built with Next.js 15 and Supabase, using a Turborepo monorepo structure. The application is production-ready with complete invitation management, anonymous RSVP functionality, and real-time tracking capabilities. It features a mobile-first design with offline PWA capabilities, elegant UI, and comprehensive security implementations.

## Project Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
The project uses Turborepo with workspace packages:

- `apps/web/` - Main Next.js application with complete invitation management
- `apps/e2e/` - Playwright E2E tests
- `packages/features/` - Feature-specific packages:
  - `invitations/` - Complete invitation management system
  - `rsvp/` - Guest lookup and RSVP response handling
  - `auth/` - Authentication and user management
  - `accounts/` - Account management and settings
- `packages/ui/` - Shared UI components (Shadcn UI + custom components)
- `packages/supabase/` - Supabase client and utilities
- `packages/i18n/` - Internationalization utilities
- `packages/next/` - Next.js specific utilities
- `packages/shared/` - Shared utilities and hooks

### Key Patterns

#### Authentication Flow
- Authentication is handled by `@kit/auth` package
- Routes are protected via middleware (`apps/web/middleware.ts`)
- User session management through Supabase Auth
- MFA support with challenge verification

#### Route Structure
- Marketing pages: `apps/web/app/(marketing)/` - Landing page with elegant design
- Auth pages: `apps/web/app/auth/` - Authentication flows
- Protected app pages: `apps/web/app/home/` - Main dashboard and invitation management
- Invitation creation: `apps/web/app/create/` - Invitation creation form
- Public invitation view: `apps/web/app/invite/[id]/` - Public invitation display
- RSVP submission: `apps/web/app/invite/[id]/rsvp/` - Anonymous RSVP form
- Offline support: `apps/web/app/offline/` - PWA offline page
- Route configuration: `apps/web/config/paths.config.ts`

#### Navigation
- Navigation configuration: `apps/web/config/navigation.config.tsx`
- Dynamic navigation based on user authentication state
- Sidebar navigation with collapsible support

#### Data Fetching
- **Server Components by Default**: Always create pages as server components for optimal performance
- **Server Actions First**: Prioritize server actions over Next.js API routes for data mutations and fetching
- **Hooks for Client-Side Only**: Use React Query hooks only when client-side data fetching is necessary (real-time updates, user interactions)
- **Navigation Optimization**: Use Next.js Link component instead of buttons for navigation with prefetching enabled

#### UI Components
- Shadcn UI components in `packages/ui/src/shadcn/`
- Custom Makerkit components in `packages/ui/src/makerkit/`
- Consistent theming with Tailwind CSS v4

#### Database
- Supabase for authentication and e-invitation data
- Complete schema with tables: invitations, guests, rsvp_responses, invitation_templates
- Migrations in `apps/web/supabase/migrations/` (use timestamped names)
- Type generation: `pnpm run supabase:web:typegen`
- Comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
- Anonymous guest access system with secure guest codes
- Storage buckets for invitation images
- Real-time RSVP tracking and statistics

### Environment Configuration
The application uses multiple environment files:
- `.env.local` - Local development
- `.env.test` - Testing environment

Key environment variables are defined in `turbo.json` globalEnv section.

## Development Notes

### Package Management
- Uses pnpm with workspace protocol (`workspace:*`)
- Dependency management through `@manypkg/cli`

## Development Guidelines

When working with this codebase, always:
1. Run `pnpm run typecheck` after making changes
2. Use the established patterns for new features
3. Follow the existing package structure when adding new functionality
4. Test authentication flows when modifying auth-related code
5. Use proper migration commands: `pnpm --filter web supabase migration new <name>`
6. Test RSVP flows with guest codes for anonymous access
7. Ensure mobile-first responsive design in all new components
8. Follow PWA best practices for offline functionality
9. Maintain comprehensive type safety throughout the application
10. **Create server components by default** - Only use client components when necessary (interactivity, hooks, browser APIs)
11. **Use server actions instead of API routes** - Prioritize server actions for data operations and mutations
12. **Optimize navigation** - Use Next.js Link with prefetching for all navigation, avoid buttons for page transitions
13. **Minimize client-side data fetching** - Use React Query hooks only when server-side data fetching is not sufficient
